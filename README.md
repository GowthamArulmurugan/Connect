## Game Rules

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

## Installation

To install and run this game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Once the game is loaded in your web browser, players can click on the columns to drop their respective pieces. The game will automatically detect and display the winner once a player forms a line of four pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
